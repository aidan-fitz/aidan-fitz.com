# Contact

The most reliable way to contact me is via email.

- Email: Very responsive, and usually not awkward. Use my Cornell email.
- Messenger: Very responsive, but will be awkward if we don’t know each other IRL.
- LinkedIn: Not awkward to contact me this way, but very unresponsive.
- Phone number: I don’t give this out to strangers and never put it on my resume unless I’m required to. I’m on Signal, so if you have my phone number in your contacts you will be able to reach me there.
