I am a software engineer and [multipotentialite](http://www.jessicayang.org/tmi) from New York City. I currently attend Cornell University for computer science and previously attended Stuyvesant High School. My technical interests include functional programming (OCaml is my favorite programming language), artificial intelligence, web development, human&ndash;computer interaction, design methods, and technology ethics.

I am an active member of the technology community and care deeply about giving back to the community and the world at large. I’m a veteran hackathon participant, mentor, and organizer - having recently won Most Innovative Hack at the Cornell Fintech Hackathon - and I have been involved in several organizations in the Computing and Information Science community at Cornell. I also contribute to several open source projects, including Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) and Lokole.

I identify as a millennial, even though I fall outside the [“official” age range that Pew uses][millennials], because I’ve always felt like people writing about millennials are writing about me. I don’t know what this “Gen Z” thing is.

My non-technical interests are varied and range from the more “intellectual” to the more “recreational”. My “intellectual” interests include: philosophy, the social sciences  (including sociology, urbanism, and economics), organizational structures, and mathematics. My “recreational” interests include: alternative rock, ukulele, the outdoors, and writing.
